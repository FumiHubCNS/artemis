1. Getting the source
=====================

1.1 Getting the tar file containing the source
----------------------------------------------

To install Artemis from source you first have to get the tar file containing the source.
This tar file can be found in the usual Artemis download ares (where?).
The files are named artemis-<version>.source.tar.gz.

Here's the short summary

1.2 Getting the source tree from git repository
-----------------------------------------------

Another way to get the source is to access the repository.
(Currently it is at the web server of CNS.)

1) Get access to the repository

% git clone mail.cns.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp:/home/ota/repos/pub/artemis.git

2) Get a specific version

% cd artemis
% git checkout 1.0.0

2. Getting ready to build
=========================

The Artemis depends on ROOT and yaml-cpp libraries.
Please refere the web sites below and install their correct versions.
Environmental variable ROOTSYS, PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH should be set correctly.

   ROOT (>5.32.0)
      http://root.cern.ch
   yaml-cpp (0.3.0)
      https://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/
   autoconf (>2.59)
      yum, apt-get etc.


3. Installation Location
========================

The default `--prefix' path is `/usr/local', which will result in the
Artemis files to be installed in `/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/lib',
etc. You can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by
giving `configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'. For more detailed
location specifications see `configure --help'.

   
4. Compilation
==============

You need to specify the correct path to the yaml-cpp library by using
the `--with-yaml-cpp' path.  You don't need to specify the path to
root libraries, since the root libraries is specified by root-config
in the Makefile.

Assuming you installed yaml-cpp to $HOME/local/{include, lib},

% cd artemis
% autoreconf --install [--verbose --force]
% ./configure --with-yaml-cpp=$HOME/local
% make

5. Install
==========

Do e.g.:

% make install
